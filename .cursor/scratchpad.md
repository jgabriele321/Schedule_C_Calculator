# Schedule C Desktop Tax Assistant - Project Plan

## Background and Motivation

The project aims to build a **Schedule C Desktop Tax Assistant** to help small business owners, freelancers, and single-member LLCs:
- Upload CSV files from credit cards or bank accounts
- Automatically classify income and business expenses
- Identify recurring vendors and high-value transactions
- Collect vehicle mileage and home office deduction data
- Output IRS-compliant **Schedule C (Form 1040)**
- Generate final export as a PDF and/or a CSV summary

### Current State Analysis
- **Frontend**: Next.js application exists with a comprehensive dashboard UI already built (`my-app/` directory)
  - UI includes file upload, transaction review, deduction input, and export interfaces
  - Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
  - Mock data and basic UI interactions are implemented
- **Backend**: **DOES NOT EXIST** - needs to be built from scratch
- **Sample Data**: 4 CSV files from different credit cards available for testing
- **Architecture**: Planned as Go backend with REST API (per Instructions.md)

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Data Format Inconsistency**: Sample CSV files have different column formats
   - Chase: `Status,Date,Description,Debit,Credit`
   - Need to normalize multiple bank/card formats into unified Transaction structure

2. **Classification Intelligence**: Need smart categorization of transactions
   - Business vs personal expenses
   - IRS Schedule C line item mapping
   - Vendor recognition and rule application

3. **Database Integration**: Persistent SQLite database
   - Use SQLite database for transaction storage that persists across app restarts
   - Can use OpenRouter/LLM to help with complex CSV parsing if needed

4. **IRS Compliance**: Accurate Schedule C calculation
   - Proper line item mapping (Lines 1-31)
   - Current mileage rate ($0.67/mile for 2024)
   - Home office deduction calculations

5. **Export Functionality**: PDF generation and CSV export
   - Must match official Schedule C form layout
   - Include detailed transaction records for accountant review

- **Target**: Individual toggles + master "Include All" toggle

**Ready to Begin Sprint 2**: Moving to implement the critical toggle feature that transforms the user experience for small business owners with mixed personal/business expenses.

**CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE**: UI/UX Quality & User Experience üö®

**Problem Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Technical Integration**: Backend + Frontend working perfectly
- ‚ùå **Visual Design**: UI described as "ugly as sin" 
- ‚ùå **User Experience**: Missing key user-friendly features
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CSS Issues**: Still experiencing some styling problems (`border-border` errors persist)

**Assessment Questions for Planning:**

1. **Visual/Design Issues**:
   - What specific aspects look "ugly"? (Colors, layout, typography, spacing, component design?)
   - Are you looking for a more professional business/accounting software aesthetic?
   - Do you have examples of tax software UIs you like? (TurboTax, FreeTaxUSA, etc.)

2. **Missing User-Friendly Features**:
   - What key features are missing from the current UI?
   - Are you looking for: Better onboarding, progress indicators, data validation, shortcuts, tooltips?
   - Should we focus on: Upload experience, transaction review workflow, or export process?

3. **Workflow & Usability**:
   - What's the ideal user journey? (Upload ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Categorize ‚Üí Export?)
   - Are there pain points in the current flow that frustrate users?
   - Do we need bulk editing, smart filters, or automation features?

4. **Technical Constraints**:
   - Should we fix the existing V0 components or start fresh?
   - Are you open to using a different UI library (Material-UI, Ant Design) or stick with shadcn/ui?
   - Do we need mobile responsiveness or is this desktop-only?

5. **Priority & Scope**:
   - What's the timeline? Quick fixes or comprehensive redesign?
   - Most important: Visual polish, feature additions, or workflow optimization?
   - Are there specific competitors or designs you want to emulate?

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Ready to Begin Sprint 1**: The plan is set for a methodical transformation into a professional Xero-style business expense tool. Starting with foundation fixes, then systematically improving each phase of the user journey.

**First Actions**:
1. Fix CSS compilation issues
2. Implement proper spacing system
3. Begin transaction page toggle implementation

**No Blockers**: Clear vision, achievable sprints, risk-tolerant approach with Git safety net.

## Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- V0 generates functional code but requires UX refinement for professional applications
- CSS compilation issues persist across different frontend implementations - need systematic approach to Tailwind config
- API integration works well, but UI layer needs user-focused design iteration
- Technical success doesn't guarantee user satisfaction - UX planning is critical
- Xero-style UI: Dark mode with subtle depth, professional typography, clear visual hierarchy
- Small business workflow: Upload ‚Üí Toggle (business/personal) ‚Üí Categorize ‚Üí Export
- Key insight: Co-mingled funds require individual transaction toggles, not just categorization
- Recurring transactions: Critical time-saver for subscriptions and regular expenses
- Desktop packaging: Electron for cross-platform .exe/.app distribution

---

**Planner Notes**: This plan follows the detailed implementation phases from Instructions.md while accounting for the existing Next.js frontend. The approach is incremental with clear success criteria for each task. The Executor should complete one task at a time and report back before proceeding.
