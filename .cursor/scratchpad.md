# Schedule C Desktop Tax Assistant - Project Plan

## Background and Motivation

The project aims to build a **Schedule C Desktop Tax Assistant** to help small business owners, freelancers, and single-member LLCs:
- Upload CSV files from credit cards or bank accounts
- Automatically classify income and business expenses
- Identify recurring vendors and high-value transactions
- Collect vehicle mileage and home office deduction data
- Output IRS-compliant **Schedule C (Form 1040)**
- Generate final export as a PDF and/or a CSV summary

### Current State Analysis
- **Frontend**: Next.js application exists with a comprehensive dashboard UI already built (`my-app/` directory)
  - UI includes file upload, transaction review, deduction input, and export interfaces
  - Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
  - Mock data and basic UI interactions are implemented
- **Backend**: **DOES NOT EXIST** - needs to be built from scratch
- **Sample Data**: 4 CSV files from different credit cards available for testing
- **Architecture**: Planned as Go backend with REST API (per Instructions.md)

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Data Format Inconsistency**: Sample CSV files have different column formats
   - Chase: `Status,Date,Description,Debit,Credit`
   - Need to normalize multiple bank/card formats into unified Transaction structure

2. **Classification Intelligence**: Need smart categorization of transactions
   - Business vs personal expenses
   - IRS Schedule C line item mapping
   - Vendor recognition and rule application

3. **Database Integration**: Persistent SQLite database
   - Use SQLite database for transaction storage that persists across app restarts
   - Can use OpenRouter/LLM to help with complex CSV parsing if needed

4. **IRS Compliance**: Accurate Schedule C calculation
   - Proper line item mapping (Lines 1-31)
   - Current mileage rate ($0.67/mile for 2024)
   - Home office deduction calculations

5. **Export Functionality**: PDF generation and CSV export
   - Must match official Schedule C form layout
   - Include detailed transaction records for accountant review

## Lessons

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Architecture**: Next.js web app + Go backend (no Electron desktop app needed)
2. **Database**: SQLite for persistent storage from the start
3. **CSV Parsing**: Handle multiple bank formats, exclude payments, use OpenRouter/LLM if needed for complex parsing
4. **Mileage Rate**: Use current 2024 rate of $0.67/mile as specified
5. **Payment Exclusion**: Never categorize or include payment transactions in expenses
6. **LLM Integration**: Use OpenRouter API for intelligent transaction categorization and Schedule C line mapping

### Environment Variables Notes
- Project will have `.env` file in root directory for configuration
- Never create new `.env` - it exists and is accessible to application
- Reference environment variables relative to project root

### Sample Data Analysis
- Chase CSV format: `Status,Date,Description,Debit,Credit`
- Transactions include mix of business/personal expenses
- Foreign transaction fees present
- Recurring subscriptions easily identifiable (GOOGLE, NETFLIX, etc.)
- Will need logic to distinguish business vs personal based on vendor and category

**Planner Notes**: This plan follows the detailed implementation phases from Instructions.md while accounting for the existing Next.js frontend. The approach is incremental with clear success criteria for each task. The Executor should complete one task at a time and report back before proceeding.
